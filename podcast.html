      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Imposter syndrome is something that many people struggle with, regardless of age or experience. But sometimes spaces that have a traditional archetype can make these feelings more intense for those who may not fit the mould. Coupled with the hype and prestige of law school, navigating new spaces, new norms, and unspoken rules can feel absolutely unbearable. In this episode, we’re talking about imposter’s syndrome from three different vantage points. Like, can we get an outline or summary for how to achieve this “confidence” we’ve been hearing about?</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">For all you 1L’s this episode will not be one you want to miss. 1L, otherwise known as the first year of law school is one of the most trying, tumultuous but foundational years of law school. The struggle is certainly real in 1L and while we do not wish we were you, if you are a current 1L or an aspiring one, but the truth is, it does get better. We’ll be talking about how to prep for 1L, what we wished we could have done now with a year of law school under our belt, and some tips and tricks on how to survive.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">We can look at brochures, welcome videos and websites, attend zoom events and open houses; but the truth is, you can really never get the full grasp of the law school experience until you’re in it - and sometimes once you’re in it, the feeling of “oh I wish I knew that” tends to come to the surface. Well, during our series we are going to be interviewing students who are currently at several law schools across the country and we’ll be using the same criteria for you all, prospective students, heck, we might even get some transfer students listening in to see what it’s like at different law schools. Our first stop, is Osgoode Hall Law School located in Toronto Canada.</p>
