  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-10">For all you 1L’s this episode will not be one you want to miss. 1L, otherwise known as the first year of law school is one of the most trying, tumultuous but foundational years of law school. The struggle is certainly real in 1L and while we do not wish we were you, if you are a current 1L or an aspiring one, but the truth is, it does get better. We’ll be talking about how to prep for 1L, what we wished we could have done now with a year of law school under our belt, and some tips and tricks on how to survive.</p>
